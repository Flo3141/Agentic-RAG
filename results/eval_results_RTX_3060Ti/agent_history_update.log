[Step 1] Reasoning: I have gathered all necessary information about the dependencies and the class functionality.

[Step 1] Reasoning: I need to find where CURRENT_MODE is defined to understand what the mode method returns.
[Step 1] Action: search_code
Args: {'search_string': 'CURRENT_MODE'}
Result: src\calculator\core.py:38: CURRENT_MODE = "Scientific"
src\calculator\core.py:61: return CURRENT_MODE

[Step 2] Reasoning: The `mode` method returns the `CURRENT_MODE` variable, which is defined as "Scientific" in calculator.core.py. The search results confirm this value and its usage. No additional context is needed to fully understand the code's behavior.
