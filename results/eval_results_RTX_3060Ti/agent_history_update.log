[Step 1] Reasoning: I need to find where CURRENT_MODE is defined to understand the operation mode string and its role in the calculator's behavior.
[Step 1] Action: search_code
Args: {'search_string': 'CURRENT_MODE'}
Result: src\calculator\core.py:38: CURRENT_MODE = "Scientific"
src\calculator\core.py:61: return CURRENT_MODE

[Step 2] Reasoning: I have analyzed the code structure, dependencies, and context. The class handles basic arithmetic with precision validation, operation logging, and input limits. CURRENT_MODE is set to 'Scientific', multiply is a placeholder, and error handling uses CalculatorError subclasses. All dependencies are resolved via RAG context and tool searches.
[Step 2] Analysis: The ArithmeticOperations class is a calculator that performs addition and subtraction with configurable precision (max 10 decimal places), validates inputs against MIN_VALUE/MAX_VALUE, and logs operations to a history list. It uses a global mode variable CURRENT_MODE (set to 'Scientific') for operation context. The multiply method is a placeholder returning 0. Dependencies include CalculatorError (for custom exceptions), logger (for audit logging), and global constants like MIN_VALUE, MAX_VALUE, and DEFAULT_PRECISION (likely 4). The class follows a robust design pattern with internal validation and audit trails.

[Step 1] Reasoning: I need to find where CURRENT_MODE is defined to understand its value and purpose in the calculator's operation modes.
[Step 1] Action: search_code
Args: {'search_string': 'CURRENT_MODE'}
Result: src\calculator\core.py:38: CURRENT_MODE = "Scientific"
src\calculator\core.py:61: return CURRENT_MODE

[Step 2] Reasoning: The `mode` method returns the value of the global variable `CURRENT_MODE`, which is explicitly set to "Scientific" in `calculator.core` (line 38). This variable is used across the system to track the current operation mode without requiring runtime computation or external dependencies.
[Step 2] Analysis: The `mode` method is a simple getter that returns the current operation mode as a string. The default value of `CURRENT_MODE` is hardcoded to "Scientific" in `calculator.core.py` (line 38), indicating the system operates in scientific mode by default. This variable is accessible globally and does not depend on any external inputs or other classes in the provided context.
